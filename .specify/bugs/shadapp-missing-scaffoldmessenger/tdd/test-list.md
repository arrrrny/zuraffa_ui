# Test List: shadapp-missing-scaffoldmessenger

## Outer loop: acceptance behaviors

One per acceptance criterion in `spec.md`.

| id | behavior | traces | state |
| -- | -------- | ------ | ----- |
| A1 | it resolves a `ScaffoldMessengerState` without throwing. | AC-1 | PENDING |
| A2 | the SnackBar's content renders in the widget tree. | AC-2 | PENDING |
| A3 | it resolves the shell's messenger without throwing. | AC-3 | PENDING |
| A4 | the user's builder output, the violation chrome, the route-contract observer and `ShadToaster`/`ShadSonner` all remain mounted above the navigator. | AC-4 | PENDING |

## Outer loop: widget behaviors

UI acceptance scenarios (bug #830): asserted through a testWidgets pair — a view-builder subject stub plus a widget test that pumps the view and asserts the scenario.

The `kind` cell is the finder-kind taxonomy (issue #1140): the scenario verbs' predicted assertion classes — presence, absence, route-outcome, enabled-state, sequence — or `none` when no finder is derivable. `zfa tdd gen` selects the assertion template by it and refuses a row whose kind column drifted from the scenario prose; verify-red's kind gate (issue #959/#964) certifies on the same vocabulary.

| id | behavior | kind | traces | state |
| -- | -------- | ---- | ------ | ----- |

## Inner loop: unit behaviors

One per functional requirement in `spec.md`.

| id | behavior | traces | state |
| -- | -------- | ------ | ----- |

## Routing provenance

Per-behavior routing decisions (issue #951): what each decision consulted — a declared marker/contract row, or the labeled legacy fallback to migrate.
