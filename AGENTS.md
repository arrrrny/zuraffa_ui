# Agent Guidelines for zuraffa_ui

## ZURAFFA MISFIRE RULE (HARD, NON-NEGOTIABLE — HARDCODED TOP RULE)

**On ANY misfire (test failure, compilation error, runtime crash, unexpected output) related to zuraffa:**

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** on the first misfire.
2. **Report the issue** to zuraffa GitHub (`arrrrny/zuraffa`) with: the command that failed, expected vs actual output, and root cause.
3. **Continue with a workaround** to make the task pass (e.g., skip the failing test, use an alternative approach, or mock the failing component).
4. **Add a comment** in the code explaining the workaround applied and linking to the zuraffa GitHub issue.

**On ANY misfire related to the repo itself (not zuraffa):**

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** on the first misfire.
2. **Report the issue** to the repo's GitHub with full details.
3. **Continue with a workaround** to make the task pass.
4. **Add a comment** in the code explaining the workaround applied.

This rule takes precedence over all other rules. Never skip a misfire or rationalize it away.
